# Python RAG News Retreival System

This RAG model is modified from a part of my individual assignment in Text Analytics Module, during the Business Analytics course at Warwick Business School 2023-2024. For the Python code use in this model, please see Colab workbook: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1WlqQmtkmjNK9OIV2fqmzc5Ura3tmSG2h?usp=sharing

# News Retrieval Augmented Generation System

In a fast-changing digital world, news data volume and its velocity make it difficult for people to stay informed and make quick decisions. Generative Pre-Trained Model (GPT) can answer questions directly, but its limited training dataset limits it. To address this, the development of a news Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system is crucial. By adding current news articles to the GPT model, the RAG system lets users use both models and updated knowledge bases in real time. Therefore, a news RAG system is essential for staying competitive in a world of abundant and fast-feeding information.
