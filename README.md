# News Retrieval Augmented Generation System

In a fast-changing digital world, news data volume and its velocity make it difficult for people to stay informed and make quick decisions. Generative Pre-Trained Model (GPT) can answer questions directly, but its limited training dataset limits it. To address this, the development of a news Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system is crucial. By adding current news articles to the GPT model, the RAG system lets users use both models and updated knowledge bases in real time. Therefore, a news RAG system is essential for staying competitive in a world of abundant and fast-feeding information.
